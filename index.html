  <h1>Grilled Cheese Sandwich</h1>
  <h2>By Generic Student</h2>

  <p>A grilled cheese (sometimes known as a toasted sandwich or cheese toastie) is a hot sandwich typically prepared by heating one or more slices of cheese between slices of bread, with a cooking fat such as butter, on a frying pan, griddle, or sandwich toaster, until the bread browns and the cheese melts.
  </p>

  <p>The cheese dream, an open-faced grilled cheese sandwich, became popular in the U.S. during the Great Depression.[1] U.S. government cookbooks describe Navy cooks broiling "American cheese filling sandwiches" during World War II.
